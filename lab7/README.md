# Partner
My partner Preet decided to use the volcano height map and colors texture to create a mountain-like area and a beach next to it. I played around with the positions and scaling of the volcano heightmap to create a mountain and beach. They also decided to make the scene unrealistic and make it colorful so hence the colorful mountains, beach, and ocean.
