For my custom particle animation, I played with the sin function to create a cluster of randomly colored billboards that expand and contract in a circle in a consistent timing pattern. Thos create a slower pulse, I made sure to fivide the inside of my sine function by a number, rather than multiplying. I use time to get a randomized value, so each pulse and contraction is slightly differed.
